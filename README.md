Flex 2 is a multi-purpose art and mapping editor for the Sega Megadrive. The original Flex was a web app, which gave it several limitations. A full rewrite for desktop opens up the ability to use real project files, as well as various other niceties.

Much inspiration has come from the tools SonMapEd, SpritePlotter, and SonikSprite - with ideas being combined and improved upon.

There is a fair amount of hidden behaviour in this application, reading this document is highly recommended before use.

## Controls

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are listed on the Mappings tab at the bottom. Some commands take a multiplier, so <kbd>32</kbd> + <kbd>Up</kbd> will move the selected mappings 32 pixels up, or <kbd>8</kbd> + <kbd>n t</kbd> will add eight new tiles.

### Inputs

You can cycle through options in dropdown boxes and increase/decrease numbers in textboxes with the mouse scroll wheel. This also works for things like colour select in drawing mode. Up/Down can also be used in textboxes.

### General UI

The UI layout is fully customisable by moving or resizing tabs.

## Mapping Editor

The mapping editor has the following mouse interactions;

| action | behaviour  |
|---|---|
| drag  | select mapping(s)  |
| double click | toggle mapping piece |
| drag (on sprite)  | move mapping(s)  |
| right drag | pan viewport |
| wheel | zoom |
