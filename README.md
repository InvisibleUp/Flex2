##  Flex 2

Flex 2 is a multi-purpose art and mapping editor for the Sega Megadrive. The original Flex was a web app, which gave it several limitations. A full rewrite for desktop opens up the ability to use real project files, as well as various other niceties.

There is a fair amount of hidden behaviour in this application, reading this document is highly recommended before use.

## UI



## Controls

Most of the keyboard shortcuts are listed on the Mappings tab at the bottom. Some commands take a multiplier, so <kbd>32</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> will moved the selected mappings 32 pixels up, or <kbd>8</kbd>+<kbd>n t</kbd> will add either new tiles.
